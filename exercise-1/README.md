# Exercise-1

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine.

Then, in the space below, put your favorite quote in a block quote, and provide a link to a website that provides additional information about the quote. When you push your changes back up to GitHub, you will see the rendered markdown file.

See `complete` branch for an example.

#My favorite quote
I'll put in a random quote I like, since I don't have a favorite

>Don't walk in front of me.. I may not follow 
Don't walk behind me... I may not lead 
Walk beside me... just be my friend
